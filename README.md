# ❤️ Efficient Heart Sound Classification using Contrastive Learning-based Knowledge Distillation

This repository presents a summer research project focused on **improving heart sound classification** using **knowledge distillation enhanced by contrastive learning**. The goal is to build lightweight and accurate deep learning models suitable for real-time medical diagnosis and low-resource environments.

---

## 📌 Objective

To apply **contrastive learning-based knowledge distillation** techniques for efficient and accurate heart sound classification, reducing model size and computation without compromising performance.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Knowledge Distillation
A technique where a smaller **student model** learns to mimic a larger, more complex **teacher model**, allowing compression of deep learning models for efficiency.

### 🔹 Contrastive Learning
Used here to enhance the distillation process by teaching the student model to recognize **relative similarities and differences** between audio signals.

### 🔹 Heart Sound Classification
Critical in cardiovascular diagnostics, this task aims to automatically identify normal vs. abnormal heart conditions from **phonocardiogram (PCG)** data.
