## 📥 Dataset Sources

1. [PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge](http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/)
2. [Kaggle Heartbeat Dataset and Baseline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brsdincer/heartbeat-sounds-classification-analysis)

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Audio samples were preprocessed and normalized.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Deep learning models: `Conv1D`, `Conv2D`, `LSTM`, and `RNN`
   - Classical ML models for benchmarking
3. **Teacher Model**: High-capacity deep learning model trained on heart sound data.
4. **Student Model**: Smaller model trained via **knowledge distillation** from teacher using contrastive loss.
5. **K-Means Clustering**: Used to improve model class separation.
6. **Visualization & Analysis**:
   - Confusion matrix
   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretability

## 📊 Results

| Model          | Accuracy (avg) | Accuracy Gain (with K-means) |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Teacher Model  | ~84%           | N/A                           |
| Student Model  | ~80%           | +2–4%                         |
| Scratch Model  | ~75%           | N/A                           |

- **Efficiency**: Student models are significantly smaller and faster.
- **Interpretability**: SHAP and confusion matrices were used to interpret predictions.
